E55: Team Bonding and Project Selection

To work together effectively as a team, you need to know at least a little bit about each other. For this assignment, please get together, face-to-face, with your team mates for around 30 minutes. For each team member, you want to learn at least the following:

    What do you want to get out of this final project (besides the obvious, which is a good grade for the course)? Are there any skills you want to practice or improve at through this project experience?
    What is your background? What skills can you bring to the final project?
    What are your time constraints? When are you available to meet? When do you plan to be able to work on the project?
    How do you prefer to be contacted? Email? Text? Slack? When do you want to be contacted? When do you not want to be contacted?

Now that you know something about each other, you need to decide what final project you want to work on. You have two options:

    Select one of the pre-defined projects posted in the final project module. If you choose that, you must come up with a new name for your project. You cannot use the “template” name for the pre-defined project (Study Buddy, Manoa Flea Market, Campus Jams, etc.).

    Create one of your own. If you decide you want to create one of your own, you must propose a final project idea to me and obtain my approval. Your proposal should take the form of a short technical essay that mimics the structure and content of the existing project specifications: overview (including the problem and the solution); mockup page ideas, use case ideas, and beyond the basics. Once the essay is published, send a DM to all of your teammates and me with the URL for me to review. I will get back to you with my comments and whether or not the idea is workable.

Submission instructions

You will have to present the results of team bonding on Thursday. The deadline posted here is just a suggestion.
